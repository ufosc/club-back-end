# Club Backend

A RESTful API for club information (events, projects, sign-ins, etc) that is used for the club website, bots, and any future projects related to administration.

The project will use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/), the [Rocket Framework](https://rocket.rs/), and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).
