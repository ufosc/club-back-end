# Open Source Projects Used

We would like to thank these awesome open source projects which help make up our project.

## Rust Web Starter

"Pre-configured starter template for web apps using React (create-react-app w/ Typescript) on the frontend and Rust (Rocket, Diesel, & PostgreSQL) on the backend." We used the Docker configs and Bash script as bases for getting Docker working for us!
